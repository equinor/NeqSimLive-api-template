# Demo Process Simulation API
This project demonstrates the use of NeqSim to create a simple process simulation API

## Description
Perform compressor efficiency calculations.

## End points

### /compressorCalc
Returns the polytropic efficiency and polytropic head for a compressor. The end point accepts gas composition, inlet and outlet pressure and inlet and outlet temperature as inputs.

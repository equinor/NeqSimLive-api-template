# NeqSim demo API
This is a simple demo API using fast API and NeqSim

Use the template, rename the demoAPI folder, make changes to the code. Test your API by running it locally as demonstrated in the example folder. 

To get it into [NeqSimLive](https://github.com/equinor/NeqSimLive) make a PR there adding the repository as a submodule.

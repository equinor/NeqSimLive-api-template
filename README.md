# NeqSim demo API
This is a template for creating a NeqSim API using fast API and the python package for [NeqSim](https://pypi.org/project/neqsim/).

## Getting started.
Click "Use this template" to create a separate repository for your application. 
A sample application is located in demoapi/src and a jupyter notebook for running the code is included in demoAPI/example.

## Develop
Try using [codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) to develop, run and test in a github-hosted cloud environment. Click "<> Code" button and select codespaces to have github set it up for you.

Cloning and running locally, even if you don't have docker, is also possible.


## Getting ready for deployment
Rename the demoAPI folder to a suitable short name for your application you are making.
Append this README.md with documentation on what this API does.

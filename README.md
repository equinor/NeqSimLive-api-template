# NeqSimLive api template
This is a template for creating a NeqSimLive API using the [NeqSim](https://pypi.org/project/neqsim/) python package. The API endpoints are created using [fastapi](https://pypi.org/project/fastapi/) and it is all packed in a docker container.


## Getting started
Click "Use this template" to generate a repository for your API.  
See demoAPI/src for a sample application and demoAPI/example for a jupyter notebook testing the API. All user development is done using python.


## Develop using Codespaces
Click the "<> Code" button and select "codespaces" if you want to use a github-hosted cloud environment instead of running locally. For more info see [codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces).


## Getting ready for deployment
Document your API in demoAPI/README.md.  
Rename the demoAPI folder to a suitable short name for your application you are making.
